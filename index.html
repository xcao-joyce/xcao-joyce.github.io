I am a Sociology and Demography Ph.D. student at Brown University <br />
I currently focus on the intersection of changes in Chinese families and child health disparities in China. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I am concerned about how disruptive events can impact both maternal and child health. <br />
I also study household labor division in China and parental time distribution in the US.  <br />
