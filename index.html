I study how parents’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics may impact their time investments on children’s future outcomes. <br />
Meanwhile, I am concerned about how disruptive events can impact both maternal and child health. <br />
Division of household labor among young couples in urban China and in the US is also one of my current topics of research.  <br />
