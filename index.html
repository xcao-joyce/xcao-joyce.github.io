I am a Ph.D. student in Sociology and a demography research trainee at Brown University. <br />
My current projects cover topics from parental time investments, child health, to migration. <br />
<br />
I study how parents’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are associated with <br />
their time investments and children’s future outcomes. I am also interested in <br />
how disruptive events impact maternal and child health. 
<br />
我叫曹欣言，现就读于布朗大学社会学系，是第三年级的博士生。<br />
研究领域：父母对孩子的教育投入不平等问题、儿童健康问题、国际/国内移民的家庭劳动分工问题。<br />
