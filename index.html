I am a Ph.D. student in Sociology and a demography trainee at Brown PSTC. <br />
My current projects cover topics from parental investments, child health, family care work, to immigration. <br />

I study how parents’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics may impact their time investments on children’s future outcomes. <br />
Meanwhile, I am concerned about how disruptive events can impact both maternal and child health. <br />
Division of household labor among young couples in urban China and in the US is also one of my current topics of research.  <br />
