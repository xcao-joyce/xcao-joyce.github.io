I am a Ph.D. student in Sociology and a demography trainee at Brown University. <br />
My current projects cover topics from parental investments, child health, family care work, to migration. <br />
<br />
I study how parents’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are associated with their time investments and children’s future outcomes. <br />
I am also interested in how disruptive events impact maternal and child health. <br />
<br />
我叫曹欣言，现就读于布朗大学社会学系，是第三年级的博士生。<br />
研究领域：父母教育投入不平等、儿童健康差异、国际/国内移民的家庭劳动分工。<br />
