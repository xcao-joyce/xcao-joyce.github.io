I am a Sociology Ph.D. candicate at Brown University. <br />
<br />
My dissertation focuses on the intersection of changes in Chinese families and child health disparities in China. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I am concerned about how childhood disruptive events, such as wildfire exposure and ADHD diagnosis, can impact maternal and child health. <br />
<br />
I also study gender inequalities in household labor division, flexible working, and work-family conflicts in multiple contexts.  <br />
